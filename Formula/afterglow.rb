# ============================================================
#  afterglow — Homebrew formula
#
#  Lives in the tap repo (Wosmos/homebrew-tap) as Formula/afterglow.rb.
#  This copy is the source of truth; the release workflow copies it across
#  with the version and sha256 substituted.
#
#      brew tap wosmos/tap
#      brew install afterglow
#      afterglow install
#
#  The formula deliberately does NOT run the installer. Homebrew formulae
#  must not write to $HOME during `brew install` — setting up your shell is
#  your call, made explicitly by running `afterglow install`.
#
#  No dependencies: the scripts are POSIX-ish bash that runs fine on the
#  bash 3.2 macOS ships, and the tools afterglow installs for you are
#  chosen at run time by `--tools`, not baked in here.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      afterglow is installed but has not changed anything yet.

      To set up your terminal:
        afterglow install --dry-run    # see exactly what it would do
        afterglow install

      Then open a new terminal:
        agdoctor      verify every part of the setup
        cheatsheet    the reference card
        theme         list themes, or switch

      To remove it later:
        afterglow uninstall
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # The dispatcher must find its payload and report the packaged version.
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/afterglow version")

    # Help must work without touching the filesystem.
    assert_match "a neon terminal", shell_output("#{bin}/afterglow help")

    # Every theme the tap ships must be listed.
    themes = shell_output("#{bin}/afterglow theme")
    %w[neon catppuccin gruvbox tokyonight].each { |t| assert_match t, themes }

    # And --dry-run must genuinely change nothing.
